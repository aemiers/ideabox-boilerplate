#### Brought to you by Annie Miers, Kristen Bair and Jahara Clark

## Got An Idea? Of Course You Do?
Between kids, bills, work, school, home and maybe a few social interactions, we all live very busy lives. Often there are thoughts racing through our head that we never quite get to; it's always "one day, I'll build that super cool invention" or "as soon as XYZ happens, I'll sit down and write that chart topping song". Then next thing we know, weeks, months and sometimes even years have gone by. Welcome to IdeaBox. We're here to help.

IdeaBox is your be-all, end-all, catch-all for all those thoughts you have that you simply can't afford to lose. Need a reminder to pay that bill next week? IdeaBox is for you. Got a plan for a patent you don't want to forget? Got that covered? Have a secret you want to get off your chest but can't tell a soul? IdeaBox won't let you down.

## So How Do You Use It, You Ask?
The beauty of IdeaBox is in it's simplicity. Just navigate to the landing page, enter the title of your idea and the idea itself in the input boxes. (Need a spark of confidence? Checkout the awesome placeholder text cheering you on!) Click the button to save it and VIOLA! your idea appears in a handy-dandy box pimped out with virtual accessories to help you get the most out of your experience.

## We Know You Want The Deets:
IdeaBox was brought to life using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.   

When IdeaBox was merely an idea and we self taught each other local storage as a team, we did the best we could by deploying local storage within our DOM (oops). We didn't realize what we'd done until other pieces of our code were *just not working quite right anymore*. This left us dead in the water because we found we were spending more time fixing what used to work than making additional progress. Ultimately, we learned that this was due to the fact that instead of using the three shell methods of saveToStorage(), deleteFromStorage() and updateIdea() on the Idea class provided in the Architecture. Our team went back to the drawing board, learned from our support network and DRYed up several of our functions, utilizing SRP as best we could. Once that was complete, we added the necessary methods on our Idea class and finally local storage worked.

DELETE Function
STAR FUNCTION

## We Gotta Pop A Bottle For:
* John Adams
  He's amazing at what he does! The fact that we were able to take him any problem from "this piece of our CSS doesn't do what we want it to do" to "why is that key not returning the value we were expecting" was invaluable. Snaps to Turing for having the foresight to understand that students in a remote environment were going to need a bit of extra support and making him available.

* Demaceo Howard
  It's one thing to be a rock. It's something else to be a whole boulder. Demaceo swooped in and help us build a "dummy playground" to test ideas and concepts in a sandbox fashion without having to worry about destroying our working code. This made it easier to make mistakes and learn the logic with no pressure. Way to be an example; we got a lot to live up to.

* Taylor Johnson
  Just when we thought we'd really gotten in the water over our heads, Taylor swooped in and showed us that all we needed to do was stand up. He's a big part of us writing less-WET code and refactoring so our functions ran optimally. The hour he spent with us really got us back on the right path.

* Jeff Kersting
  Jeff is not your average student. One minute, he's following along in the lesson with the rest of us and then next! he's sharing some in depth logic he was tinkering with on the side that's helping us recall things from local storage and re-instantiating classes. That sharing helped us refine our process in order to delete cards without losing the rest on page refresh. Way to be a part of the team!

* Joel Lacey
  Who knew that JSON strips Classes of their methods? Not us! Who knew that our code didn't work because all of a sudden, the Idea class was suddenly, inexplicably missing it's methods? Definitely not us! Joel came to our rescue in the best way, helping us with insider knowledge about JSON and Local Storage that really took our project to the next level.

* Trisha Langlois
  When we needed to understand non-native DOM element manipulation and event delegation, Trisha is where we ran! She reassured us that we were on the right track, that our instincts were worthy being followed and that we were closer than we knew. Oh, how we needed that!

* Annie Wolff
  Parents and children aren't just for humans. Our elements needed to be properly targeted and Annie helped reset and recalibrate. She's why many of our click functions happen the way they do. Need to click something? BAM! It works. Don't want to click the thing you didn't actually mean to click? She cleared that up, too.

## Where Do We Go From Here
* Comments and Bonus Material
  Wanna add even more details? Got a link to reference? Need to take a picture of that receipt to keep track of the materials you purchased to 'get 'er done'? Wrap 'em up and put a bow on 'em! That's what comments are for.

* IdeaBox in your pocket
  Ideas don't just happen at home, so why be limited to you desktop? A mobile app will mean you can access, add to and complete your ideas no matter where you are.

* Progress Tracker
  Rome wasn't built in a day and we're willing to bet that your Christmas cards won't be finished that quickly either. A progress tracker will let you update your idea cards every step of the way, so you can get that instant-gratification of seeing tasks well on their way.

* Calendar Syncing and Integration
  We know you *said* you wanted to call grandma at 5pm, but what doesn't get scheduled doesn't get done. Let IdeaBox send you reminders or set an alarm to ensure your ideas become realities.
